## [Unreleased](https://github.com/craft-ai/craft-ai-client-js/compare/v1.16.0...HEAD) ##

### Added ###

- Bulk update. The client now contains `createAgentBulk`, `deleteAgentBulk`, `addAgentContextOperationsBulk` and `getAgentDecisionTreeBulk` methods to create, delete, add operations or retrieve trees to several agents at a time.

## [1.16.0](https://github.com/craft-ai/craft-ai-client-js/compare/v1.15.4...v1.16.0) - 2019-04-09 ##

### Added ###

- Support timezones as UTC offset in minutes
- Support V2 trees including:
    - Missing values: it is now possible to handle missing values by adding `deactivate_missing_values: false` in the agent configuration. Missing values correspond to a `null` value in a given context.
    - Optional values: it is now possible to handle optional values by adding `is_optional: true` for a property in the agent configuration. Optional values are defined by `{}`, the empty Object, in a given context.
    - The multi-enum operator `Ã¬n`.
    - Boolean values
- Predictions now return the number of samples in the leaf and its distribution if it is a classification problem.
- Predictions now return min and max information for continuous output values.
- For continuous output values, it is now possible to get the mean and standard deviation values from any node in a tree.
- For continuous output values, it is now possible to get the min and max values from any node in a tree.

## [1.15.4](https://github.com/craft-ai/craft-ai-client-js/compare/v1.15.3...v1.15.4) - 2018-11-27 ##

### Changed ###

- `client.getAgentDecisionTree` deals with the retry in a slightly different way, it shouldn't have any impact on the SDK users but improve the occupation of **craft ai** infrastructures.
- `cfg.decisionTreeRetrievalTimeout` increased from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.

## [1.15.3](https://github.com/craft-ai/craft-ai-client-js/compare/v1.15.2...v1.15.3) - 2018-11-13 ##

### Fixed ###

- The conversion from timestamps to time of day is properly rounded. Example: for a timestamp of 1498882800 (01/07/2017 06:20), the time of day is now formatted in '06:20:00' instead of '06:19:59' previously.

## [1.15.2](https://github.com/craft-ai/craft-ai-client-js/compare/v1.15.1...v1.15.2) - 2018-08-07 ##

### Fixed ###

- The `proxy` settings now works properly when set to `undefined`.

### Changed ###

- Add new function `interpreter.formatProperty` formatting a property and its value.

### Changed ###

- Function deprecation notices are now logged only once, using `console.warning`.

## [1.14.1](https://github.com/craft-ai/craft-ai-client-js/compare/v1.14.0...v1.14.1) - 2018-06-06 ##

### Changed ###
